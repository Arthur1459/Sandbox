# IA Walk Learning

### by Arthur1459

### This project aims to simulate the walk learning process.

Based on my "Flow" physic engine, a body is trying to learn how to walk.
The learning is base on evolution theory. The genetic of the body
contains the amplitude and pulsation of different movement possible.
The score is the distance to the right side, the more the distance is short, the more the
genetic is kept.

Here is the body trained (orange):
